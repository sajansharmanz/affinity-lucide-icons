# Affinity Lucide Icons

This repository contains a categorized **Assets file for Affinity Designer** featuring the full [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) set.

## ðŸ”§ Regenerating the Asset File Yourself

If you'd like to generate a categorized icon set yourself:

### 1. Clone the [Lucide Icons repo](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide
cd lucide
```

### 2. Add the Python Script

Place the provided `categorize_lucide_icons.py` script (found in the `scripts/` folder of this repo) into the root of the cloned Lucide repo.

### 3. Run the Script

```bash
python categorize_lucide_icons.py
```

This will generate a `categorized-icons/` folder, with each icon copied into folders that match its Lucide categories.
